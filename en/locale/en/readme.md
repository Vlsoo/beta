# Introducing GitLocalize, a continuous localization platform for GitHub repository

We are excited to announce the beta launch of our new localization platform, GitLocalize!

GitLocalize is a continuous localization platform for GitHub repositories and automates the process for developers. Because of the ever-changing nature of Internet-related product, keeping localizing them has been really challenging. GitLocalize solves this by connecting to your GitHub repository and naturally integrating with your development workflow in just a few clicks.
